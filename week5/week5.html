			If you've ever listened to Micheal Jackson's hit song, "Smooth Criminal", you probably have at some point <br>
 			wondered who the muse for the woman named "Annie" that is mentioned in the lyrics is. You may already know <br>
			that the name "Annie," is derived from the common dummy that is used in CPR training called "Rescusci Anne",<br> 			or "Rescue Annie." When learning CPR, you are instructed to ask "Annie, are you okay?" before beginning <br> 				resuscitation; hence, the lyrics "Annie are you okay?". Annie in Smooth Criminal is inspired by a CPR <br>
			dummy, but did you know that both Annie and Rescusci Anne are both derived from a woman who is speculated <br>
			to have existed? <br>

			As the story goes: in the late 1880s, the body of a young woman was discovered in the River of Seine in <br>
			Paris. Around the time the body was discovered, many people were intrigued by how beautiful she was, but <br>
			nobody knew who this girl was, so she was then dubbed "L'Inconnue de la Seine," or in English, "The Unkown <br> 			Woman of Seine." A pathologist at the Paris Morgue was so fascinated by her well portioned face that he made <br> 			a cast of her death mask which you may recognize as the face of many CPR dummies that are used to this day. <br>
